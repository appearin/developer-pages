<p class="alert alert-danger">The embedded version and the Developer SDK has been shut down.</p>

<p class="ingress">
The API has been shut down on June 30th 2017. Existing installs will
continue to work, but may cease to function without notice. It is recommended
that you move away from the appear.in API as soon as possible.
</p>

For websites that currently have the embed version running, there will be no
change to the code. However, users that enter the room name that is indicated
in the code, will now be taken to a new tab with the video room, instead of
opening directly on your web page.

The following options will still be able available to utilize appear.in with
your website:
- You can keep the embed code from the API as is today, but instead of opening
  within your website itself, a new tab will open.
- You can create a custom button on your site that links to an appear.in room
  of your choice.
